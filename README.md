Meza1 Settings
==============

This repository is designed to provide settings for systems built upon the Meza1 architecture. It is separate from the Meza1 repository so it can be included as a small configuration directory within a wiki, rather than pulling the entirety of the of the Meza1 setup. The Meza1 setup process ideally should only need to be run once, whereas the Meza1Settings repository is in constant use and may require modification over the life of a wiki.

Current State
-------------

Currently this repository is being used to unify the existing configurations of all the FOD Semantic Wikis. Once they are unified this repository will begin to be used with Meza1 to provide configuration. The current state is aimed at MediaWiki 1.23, since that's what the FOD Semantic Wikis are at present. In future versions it will be focused on MediaWiki 1.25 or greater.
